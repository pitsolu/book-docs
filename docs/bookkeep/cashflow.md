## Cashflow Formula

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Add your net income and depreciation, then subtract your capital expenditure and change in working capital.   

```
Free Cash Flow = Net income + Depreciation/Amortization – Change in Working Capital – Capital Expenditure.
```

### Operating Cashflow

Calculating cash flow from operations is easy. All you have to do is subtract your taxes from the sum of depreciation, change in working capital, and operating income. 

```
Operating Cash Flow = Operating Income + Depreciation – Taxes + Change in Working Capital.
```

### Cash Flow Statement

Add or subtract all the cash from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Then, add the result to your beginning cash balance. This is interpreted as; 

```
Cash Flow = Cash from operating activities +(-) Cash from investing activities +(-) Cash from financing activities + Beginning cash balance
```

## Indirect vs. Direct Method

There are two methods by which CFS can be presented:

Indirect Method: In the U.S., the indirect method is far more common, whereby the starting line item is net income, which is adjusted for non-cash items (e.g. depreciation & amortization) and changes in working capital to arrive at cash flow from operations.

Direct Method: Net income is not the starting point for this method, but rather, the direct method explicitly lists out the cash received and paid out to third parties during the period (e.g. cash from customers, cash to suppliers).

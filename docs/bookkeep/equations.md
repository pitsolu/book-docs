Accounting Equation With Revenue and Expense
===

1. Basic accounting equations can be extended by incorporating the equity component of the owner, ie capital, revenue, and expenses as follows:

	> Asset = Liability + Owner’s Equity
	> Asset = Liability + [Capital + Net Profit]
	> Asset = Liability + [Capital + (Revenue-Expense)]

	Which,

	> Asset = Liability + Capital + Revenue – Expense

2. When a transaction involves revenue and expense, profit or loss will be available:

	> Revenue > Expense → Net Profit → Owner’s Equity increase
	> Revenue < Expense → Net Loss → Owner’s Equity decrease

3. From the accounting equation, the revenue derived from the transactions will lead to an increase in assets, or the reduction of liabilities. Such instances include:

	- a. When merchandise is sold in cash, assets are increased in cash.
	- b. If the merchandise is sold on a credit basis, assets are increased in the form of debtors.
	- c. If the proceeds are used to pay the creditor, the liability will be reduced in the form of creditors.

4. Expenses result in asset diminution, or in other words, an increase in liabilities. When an item is paid in cash, liability is incurred in cash, or rather, the assets in cash are reduced. If an expense remains unpaid, the liability increases in the form of accrued expenses.

### Owner’s Equity

1. The owner’s equity is the liability of the business side to its owner. This is because business owners lend money to businesses as capital to start their business.
2. Owners’ equity included:
	- a) the capital invested by the owner into the business (initial investment and additional investment)
	- b) net profit because of profitable business activities
3. Capital investment by the owner and net profit will increase owner’s equity while the uptake and loss will reduce the owner’s equity. Observe the following formula:

	> Early Capital + Nett profit – Drawing = Final Capital
	> Early Capital – Nett loss – Drawing = Final Capital

4. The owner’s equity is the owner’s claim on the business assets.

### Liabilities

3. Liabilities can be divided into two types, namely:
	- a) Long term liability (> 1 year)
	- b) Current liabilities (< 1 year)

## Cost Concept

1. For firms that manufacture their own goods for sale. The Production Account is provided to calculate the cost of production.

2. There are two types of costs in production, ie:

	- Fixed Cost
	- Cost Changed a.k.a Marginal Cost

	>> Production cost = Fixed cost + Cost changed

### Fixed Cost

1. Fixed costs are costs that are unchanged even though the amount of production increases or decreases.
2. Examples of fixed costs are rent, insurance on plant and machinery, land tax, depreciation of fixed assets, manager’s salaries, and factory supervisors.
3. In the long run, fixed costs may increase as production continues to grow. For example, the factory supervisor’s salaries may increase as more factory supervisors are hired to supervise the increasing number of factory workers due to the increase in production.

### Cost Changed

1. Cost changed is the cost that changes when the number of production changes. Cost changed increases when production amount increases and decreases when the production amount decreases.
2. Examples of cost changed are the cost of raw materials, labor costs, and other expenses that change just about the change in production.


In the production of goods, the cost involved can also be divided into three components, namely:

- Material cost
- Labor cost
- Overhead cost

## Labor Cost

Labor cost is cost changed. This cost increase when production increases and otherwise decreases when production decreases. Examples of factory workers’ salaries.

## Overhead Cost

1. Overhead cost is the cost that is not directly related to the production process but is related to the management and factory general operation.

2. Overhead cost includes:
	- a) indirect salary, that is, salaries paid to factory executives, factory engineers, managers, and factory supervisors. These employees are involved in the factory general operation  and they are not directly involved in the production
	- b) factory rental
	- c) factory insurance
	- d) factory payment rate
	- e) repair and maintenance of plant and machinery
	- f) depreciation of plant and machinery
	- g) depreciation of small tools  in the factory
	- h) factory land tax

3. In general, the overhead cost is fixed cost. However, there is still some exception. For example, electrics payments will increase as production increases as a result of using more machines.

## Work In Progress

1. Production is a staggered and continuous process.
2. At the end of the accounting year, there must be some unfinished items that are still in the process of production.
3. Unfinished items are called work in process, work is in progress, or semi-finished goods.
4. At the end of the accounting year, work in process is assessed by:
	- a) Raw material cost
	- b) Labor cost
	- c) Overhead cost

5. There are two values ​​for work in process:
	- a) work in the (initial) process brought forward from the previous accounting year.
	- b) work in the (final) process that is valued at the end of the current accounting year

6. Work in the initial process is mixed and work in the final process is rejected for calculating the production cost for a certain period.

## Contribution Margin Formula

1. Break-even point can be calculated using the margin formula contribution.
2. Margin contribution per unit is the selling price per unit minus the cost changed per unit. Margin contribution per unit represents excess selling price per unit.

	> Contribution margin(per unit) = Sale price per unit – cost changed per unit

3. Contribution margins help firms accommodate  with fixed costs and contribute to operating income.

4. The break-even point will change when there is a change on:
	- a) Fixed cost
	- b) Sales price per unit
	- c) Cost changed per unit

5. In conclusion, management can plan to achieve higher profits with:
	- a) Reduce fixed cost
	- b) Reduce cost changed per unit
	- c) Increase sales price per unit
6. Contribution Margin can be disclosed as:
	- a) Ratio `Contribution Margin: Sales Price`
	- b) Percentage
	- c) Value of money per unit

### Block Numbering

You may or may not see the number system in your accounting system.

Ensure these subaccounts are all organized into the corresponding master account, a number system is necessary.

This is usually done with a method referred to as `block numbering`

It's pretty straightforward: you assign a master account to a large number and block out a section of numbers then reserved for that master account's lesser subaccounts.

For example:

> 1000 - Assets
>> 1100 - Residential property
>> 1200 - Commercial property

Then, under each subaccount, you'd have further subaccounts:

> 1100 - Residential
>> 1101 - 326 Labarca Ave.
>> 1102 - 7965 Meron St.
>> 1103 - 900 Bannon St.
> 1200 - Commercial
>> 1201 - The Stellaris
>> 1202 - Palm Drive Business Park

### Separate Administrative & Property Management Operations

One of the unique needs of property management companies is that they have two levels of their business:

* Service: Managing properties
* Administrative: Managing the business itself

These are two very different sets of tasks and should be kept separate to maintain accurate accounting.

If you don't keep these separate, it will be challenging to do anything with your accounting because your reports will be muddled, whether you're looking for information on the properties you manage or your business overhead.

### Have COA Gaps In Numbering 

It's impossible to know just how many accounts you'll need over the next decade (and beyond) for your chart of accounts.

If you set up your number system without enough space between each category, you'll end up with a very confusing and inconvenient system.

What's the solution? Set up your number system by the thousands and hundreds.

For example, your master category takes a thousand (4xxx), while each subcategory takes a hundred (41xx, 42xx, 43xx)
